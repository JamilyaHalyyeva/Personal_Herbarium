## CLIENT SIDE

Dear Issa and Jamilya this is the client side
Feel free to discuss and share any ideas you might have 

#### These are the dependencies and libraries you are supposed to have in your package.json after installing: npm i 
- axios
- react-router-dom
  
Other libraries can be added upon a joint confirmation 

#### Login / Register
- Should include the registration form for first entrance upon the application (This is where the User creates their own profile, chooses a theme and safely enters their little herbarium space)
  
#### Homepage
- Should include navbar (user name and picture they chose, logo, about, info section)
- Content (Where their gallery of plants is posted which means here they will find: - ADD button) 
- Small guide on how to a User can make their herbarium 
- Sidebar (with a search form and category filtering which will update once they create their own plant)
- Footer (additional info, references, policy etc.)

#### Plant (info)
- Provides the user to have everything that has been specified in the Model

#### Add Plant 
- A form that pops out once a user clicks on ADD button (Let's the User input all necessary info they want for their own Plant) 

# NOTICE
After the basic things have been successfully set up, we can move to adding:

- Functionality for Users to add notes under their Plants only they can see
- Favorites and Favorites special page where users can track their favorite plants
